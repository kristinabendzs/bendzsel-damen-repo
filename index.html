    <p>Wendys focuses on serving fresh high quality food for a fair price.
         They have a diverse menu, with breakfast items to lunch/dinner items. 
         Wendyâ€™s food is delicious, the frosty-fry combo, where you replace your 
         drink with a frosty then dip your fries is one of the best things you can 
         get from any fast food restaurant. Their fries and chicken are of higher 
         quality than most other food chains, along with their square burger patties 
         adding their own touch to the burgers. Other food chains serve food that tastes 
         and looks fake. At wendys you feel like you're eating good quality food that won't 
         leave your stomach turning and hurting at the end of the day. They have quick and 
         friendly service, so your overall experience is pleasant.</p>
