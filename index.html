            <p>Harvey’s is currently the best fast food chain in Canada. 
                Harvey’s is a 100% Canadian owned company who sources all 
                of their beef, poultry, vegetables, and dairy from local 
                Canadian farms. I think Harvey’s is the superior fast 
                food choice because they allow their guests to create 
                their very own burger with whatever toppings they prefer. 
                With most other fast food chains, you are limited to the 
                hamburgers and wraps that already have pre chosen toppings. 
                However, at Harvey’s, you can customize your hamburger 
                however you please, from the patty choice to the condiments. 
                In addition, Harvey’s has some excellent milkshakes that 
                put most other restaurants to shame. They are delicious, 
                not too runny and not too thick, and make the best dipping 
                “sauce” for french fries! Lastly, Harvey’s has some of the 
                best poutine available. It is a classic Canadian staple that 
                many fast food chains like Mcdonalds or Tim Hortons still 
                botch. But Harvey’s? They have it right! With its proper beef 
                gravy, soft but-not-soggy fries, and squeaky cheese curds, 
                Harvey’s poutine is one of the best being served.
