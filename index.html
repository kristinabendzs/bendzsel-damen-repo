            <p>Harvey’s is currently the best fast food chain in Canada. 
                Harvey’s is a 100% Canadian owned company who sources all 
                of their beef, poultry, vegetables, and dairy from local 
                Canadian farms. I think Harvey’s is the superior fast 
                food choice because they allow their guests to create 
                their very own burger with whatever toppings they prefer. 
                With most other fast food chains, you are limited to the 
                hamburgers and wraps that already have pre chosen toppings. 
                However, at Harvey’s, you can customize your hamburger 
                however you please, from the patty choice to the condiments. 
                In addition, Harvey’s has some excellent milkshakes that 
                put most other restaurants to shame. They are delicious, 
                not too runny and not too thick, and make the best dipping 
                “sauce” for french fries! Lastly, Harvey’s has some of the 
                best poutine available. It is a classic Canadian staple that 
                many fast food chains like Mcdonalds or Tim Hortons still 
                botch. But Harvey’s? They have it right! With its proper beef 
                gravy, soft but-not-soggy fries, and squeaky cheese curds, 
                Harvey’s poutine is one of the best being served.

          <p>Wendys focuses on serving fresh high quality food for a fair price.
         They have a diverse menu, with breakfast items to lunch/dinner items. 
         Wendy’s food is delicious, the frosty-fry combo, where you replace your 
         drink with a frosty then dip your fries is one of the best things you can 
         get from any fast food restaurant. Their fries and chicken are of higher 
         quality than most other food chains, along with their square burger patties 
         adding their own touch to the burgers. Other food chains serve food that tastes 
         and looks fake. At wendys you feel like you're eating good quality food that won't 
         leave your stomach turning and hurting at the end of the day. They have quick and 
         friendly service, so your overall experience is pleasant.</p>
